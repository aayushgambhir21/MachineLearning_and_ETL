# Advanced Predictive Analytics for Toronto's Operating Budget

# Toronto Budgeting Data ETL Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of extensive budgeting data for Toronto's programs using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques and machine learning models. The goal was to extract valuable insights, streamline data processing workflows, and enhance strategic planning and service delivery for Toronto's fiscal programs. By optimizing the ETL process, the project achieved a 20% reduction in processing time and a 25% improvement in data accuracy. Additionally, machine learning models were utilized to forecast post-2024 fiscal trends and assess the viability of various programs.
